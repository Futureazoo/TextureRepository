A Sample:

These textures are free to use by mod authors, texture artists, and custom map makers. 
Please credit the artist for any texture you use from this repository.

If you would like to contribute to the repository, submit a pull request. 
Create a new folder under your username and organize them based on blocks and items. (further internal organization is encouraged)

-----------------

I hope this comes in handy to any mod authors who don't enjoy texturing, or anyone looking for inspiration.

Enjoy!
